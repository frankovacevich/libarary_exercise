<h1>Library exercise</h1>

<p>This is the library exercise, there are three important files:</p>

<ul>
	<li>db_functions.py. Contains all the functions related to the database, such as inserting books and users</li>
	<li>mv_functions.py. Contains the functions that lends and return books</li>
	<li>st_functions.py. Contains some functions that give some insight on the database</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the structure of all these files before you start to code. It is important that you understand the basic rules of this library.</p>

<p>The structure of the database is not given. There are some fields that must be present though. For books, see the file books.csv, and for users see users.cvs.</p>

<p>A history of all the times a book is lent or returned must also be present (see st_functions.py)</p>

<p>It is also your task to write a simple test code (test.py) to test the basic functionality of your code.</p>

<p>Have fun :)</p>
